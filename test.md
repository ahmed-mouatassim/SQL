Okay, here's a markdown summary of the video content about the SQL LIKE operator.

# SQL LIKE Operator - Video Summary

This video explains how to use the `LIKE` operator in SQL for pattern matching in string data, primarily demonstrated using phpMyAdmin with a `users` table that has a `name` column.

## Introduction to LIKE

*   The `LIKE` operator is used in a `WHERE` clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.
*   It's essential for searching text-based data.

## Wildcard Characters

Two main wildcard characters are used with `LIKE`:

1.  **`%` (Percent Sign):** Represents zero, one, or multiple characters.
2.  **`_` (Underscore):** Represents a single character.

## Examples Demonstrated

The presenter uses a `users` table with columns like `id`, `email`, `name`, `age`, `country`. The focus is on the `name` column.

1.  **Find names starting with a specific letter/string:**
    *   Names starting with 'W':
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'W%';
        ```
        *   This would return users like 'Wael', 'Waleed'.
    *   Names starting with 'WA':
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'WA%';
        ```
        *   This would also return 'Wael', 'Waleed'.
    *   Names starting with 'WAE':
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'WAE%';
        ```
        *   This would return 'Wael'.

2.  **Find names ending with a specific letter/string:**
    *   Names ending with 'L':
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE '%L';
        ```
        *   This would return users like 'Wael', 'Basel'.

3.  **Find names containing a specific letter/string anywhere:**
    *   Names containing 'E':
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE '%E%';
        ```
        *   This would return users like 'Wael', 'Basel', 'Thaer', 'Waleed'.

4.  **Find names where a specific letter is in a certain position (using `_`):**
    *   Names where the second letter is 'A':
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE '_A%';
        ```
        *   This would return users like 'Wael', 'Basel', 'Waleed'. (The first `_` matches the first character, 'A' matches the second, and `%` matches the rest).

5.  **Find names starting with a specific letter and having a minimum length (using `_`):**
    *   Names starting with 'W' and having at least two characters:
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'W_%';
        ```
        *   This would return 'Wael', 'Waleed', 'wa'. (The presenter adds a user 'wa').
    *   Names starting with 'W' and having at least three characters:
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'W__%';
        ```
        *   This would return 'Wael', 'Waleed'. It would not return 'wa' because 'wa' only has two characters.

6.  **Find names starting with one letter/string and ending with another:**
    *   Names starting with 'W' and ending with 'L':
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'W%L';
        ```
        *   This would return 'Wael'.
    *   Names starting with 'T' and ending with 'R':
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'T%R';
        ```
        *   This would return 'Thaer'.

## Key Takeaways

*   `LIKE` is powerful for flexible text searches.
*   `%` is for any sequence of characters (including none).
*   `_` is for exactly one character.
*   These wildcards can be combined in various ways to create complex search patterns.
*   The video also mentions W3Schools as a good resource for learning more about SQL operators.
